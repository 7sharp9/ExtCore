        <summary>ExtCore is an extended core library for F#.</summary>
        <description>ExtCore provides extensions to the F# core library (FSharp.Core) and aims to help you build industrial-strength F# applications. These extensions include additional functions for modules such as Array, List, Set, and Map; immutable IntSet, IntMap, LazyList, and Queue collections; a variety of computation expressions (workflows); and "workflow collections" -- collections modules which have been adapted to work seamlessly from within workflows.</description>
